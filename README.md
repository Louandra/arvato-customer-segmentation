# arvato-customer-segmentation

## Motivation
The aim of the project is to enable a mail-order company selling organic products to acquire customers more efficiently by using a targeted approach. Using the provided demographics data of the population and the company's customer base, we need to match the attributes of the wider population to those of the customers in order to figure out which are potential clients for the mail order company.
